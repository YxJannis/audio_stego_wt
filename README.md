# Audio Steganography
Experimental code for embedding steganographic messages in audio signals using (multilevel) Discrete Wavelet Transform.
Additionally, properties of embedding with different wavelet types and embedding bit positions were analyzed.
For analysis results, see https://yxjannis.github.io/wavelets/.

Furthermore, some methods for steganalysis were tested and analyzed.
